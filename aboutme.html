  <h1>Roseanne Thomas's Crafting Projects<em>CSS</em></h1>
</header>

My name is Roseanne Thomas.  Right now I am taking First Nations Technology Council.  I am taking up computer programs that include Bacic Computer, Communication and Digital Marketing, Network Setup and Support, Website Developement and Code, Software Testing and GIS Mapping.
Crafting.  I enjoy beading, knitting, and crocheting.  It relaxes my mind, brings me into my own world of imagination walking in the mountains.  Taking a bath, walking around the mountains.  Making me feel lighter in the inside.  The rain replenishing my soul, as it hits my body.  Clearâ€™s my mind out.   Makes me think about what I can do for the tomorrows.   This sounds refreshing to me, I think I might try it.

Hello world I am learning to code.
